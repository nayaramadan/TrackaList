✨ Trackalist ✨


What is Trackalist?
Trackalist is meant to be a website where you launch into a page with a simple to-do list!

Why was it created?
I created Trackalist to expand on my html/css knowledge (I'm not very good with javascript, so I had to get help!) and in hopes that my coding knowledge would expand. Another primary reason I created Trackalist for was because of how other to-do lists functioned; too much clutter, unaesthetic, and too mind-occupying, especially when an assingment is due asap!

How was Trackalist created?
Trackalist was created through tears and struggles. Although it is more of a 'simple' project, since I am esepecially new to github, vscode, and the similar, there were a few tough moments throughout.
I created trackalist through two html files (one main page, another subpage) and with their corresponding CSS pages (for a simple aesthetic!)

What did I learn through this creation process?
- How to use the simple features of Github
- How to publish codespaces
- How to create public links for my website
- Somwehat learned javascript scripture
- Especially learned javascript features and how important it really is to elevating a project!
- How to connect CSS files and HTML files without having both codes in the same file!

What should I do in the future to elevate Trackalist, or even other projects?
I definitely know that compared to others, my time within this project was not fully committed to coding. A few chunks of the entire 10-ish hours was spent JUST learning how to do everything with ease.
Now that I am more knowledgeable, I will definitely be able to spend majority of my time coding HTML and CSS in the future. However, I would also like to try and gain some more familiarity with other languages; from this project, javascript, and in majority of my future projects, ESPECIALLY python!!

***Note: A lot of my time was also spent configuring the git through terminal and powershell!

Big thanks to w3schools and other sources for guiding me through the whole process, as well as the very helpful AthenaAward links within the Slack!!

Thank you for viewing my project!! I hope to update Trackalist much more, even outside of AthenaAwards!
